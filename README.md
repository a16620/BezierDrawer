# BezierDrawer
Vanilla Js application to draw and edit Bezier curves
I used HTML Canvas. 

Drawing mode:
You can draw by left mouse button.
If you finish single line, press right button to focus out the line. so you can draw new lines.

Edit mode:
Move point by left click.
Remove point by right click.(Removing might cause lag)
